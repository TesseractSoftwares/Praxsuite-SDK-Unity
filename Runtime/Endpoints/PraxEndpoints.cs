    /// An endpoint is a URL in your workspace bound to an automation you built in the portal.
    /// The client posts a payload; the automation decides what actually happens. This is where
    /// every rule a player must not be able to break belongs:
    ///
    ///   - granting currency, items or XP        (client says "I killed the boss", server decides the reward)
    ///   - submitting a score                    (server validates it is reachable before writing it)
    ///   - spending currency                     (server checks the balance it owns)
    ///   - anything involving another player     (server enforces who may touch whom)
    ///
    /// The rule of thumb: if a modified client sending an arbitrary payload could get something
    /// it should not, that operation belongs in an endpoint and the table behind it must not be
    /// writable by the player's role. A direct table write is right for a player's own
    /// cosmetic state - settings, last-played level, key bindings - and wrong for anything with
    /// value.
    ///
    /// Two modes, set per endpoint in the portal:
    ///   Sync  - holds the connection, runs one automation, returns its Response node output.
    ///           Use <see cref="CallAsync"/> when you need the answer.
    ///   Async - returns immediately, runs subscribed automations in the background.
    ///           Use <see cref="FireAsync"/> for telemetry and fire-and-forget events.
